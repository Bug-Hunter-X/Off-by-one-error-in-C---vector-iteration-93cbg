This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when iterating through a vector using a for loop.  The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= vec.size()` attempts to access an element beyond the valid range of indices.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate, ensuring that the loop terminates before accessing the element at `vec.size()`. This can lead to unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior.  The solution provided addresses this by changing the loop condition to `i < vec.size()`.
